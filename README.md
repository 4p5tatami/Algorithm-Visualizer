# Algorithm-Visualizer
A personal little project to visualize algorithms on your own input. For now it only supports simple undirected unweighted graphs as input, and can only visualize DFS and BFS traversal algorithms. Will add more kinds of inputs and algorithms later (hopefully)

Make sure you have Python 3.11 or above. Clone the repo, browse to the root directory in your terminal, and then simply run
```bash
python main.py
